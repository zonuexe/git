hook.<name>.command::
	A command to execute whenever `hook.<name>` is invoked. `<name>` should
	be a unique "friendly" name which you can use to identify this hook
	command. (You can specify when to invoke this command with
	`hook.<name>.event`.) The value can be an executable on your device or a
	oneliner for your shell. If more than one value is specified for the
	same `<name>`, the last value parsed will be the only command executed.
	See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.event::
	The hook events which should invoke `hook.<name>`. `<name>` should be a
	unique "friendly" name which you can use to identify this hook. The
	value should be the name of a hook event, like "pre-commit" or "update".
	(See linkgit:githooks[5] for a complete list of hooks Git knows about.)
	On the specified event, the associated `hook.<name>.command` will be
	executed. More than one event can be specified if you wish for
	`hook.<name>` to execute on multiple events. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.jobs::
	Specifies how many hooks can be run simultaneously during parallelized
	hook execution. If unspecified, defaults to the number of processors on
	the current system.
